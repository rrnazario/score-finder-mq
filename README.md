## Testing

At EnvironmentHelper.cs (ScoreFinder.Infra project) you can mock a file with centralized variables, such as MQ informations, tokens, connection strings etc. with this sintax:

VARIABLE1|VALUE1

VARIABLE2|VALUE2

(...)

Save this file and fill the full path in "mockFileFullPath" variable at GetValue() method.

Debug "ScoreFinder.Orquestrador", "ScoreFinder.Controller" and "ScoreFinder.Presentation.Telegram" projects.
